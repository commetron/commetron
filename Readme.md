## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Senior Mobile Developer with extensive experience building cross-platform and native mobile applications that are performant, scalable, and maintainable. With a strong focus on user experience and engineering excellence, I’ve delivered production-grade apps across fintech, e-commerce, health tech, and social domains.

I specialize in Flutter and React Native, also work with native Android (Kotlin/Java) and iOS (Swift). My approach is rooted in clean architecture, testability, CI/CD automation, and seamless UX across devices.
